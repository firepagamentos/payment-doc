# Introduction

Welcome to the Fire Pagamentos API documentation. This is a REST API that allows you to integrate Fire Pagamentos payment gateway into your application. Fire Pagamentos is a robust and versatile payment solution, allowing your application to handle a variety of payment methods efficiently.

## API Overview

Our API is organized around REST principles. We use standard HTTP protocol methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 

For the communication, we use conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

## Getting Started

To start using the Fire Pagamentos API, you'll need to obtain an API key. This key is required to authenticate all of your API requests. For more information about getting your API key, see our API key guide.

Once you have your API key, you can use it in the `apiKey` header parameter in your API requests.
